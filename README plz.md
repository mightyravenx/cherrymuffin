🍓 Strawberry Valentine (My First Coding Project) 🍓
This was my very first web project a cute interactive valentine I made during the early days of learning how to code.
It may have started as something personal, but it's become a piece of my creative journey and a reminder of how far I've come since.

Why It Matters (To Me)
It helped me realize that **code can be a love language**, too.

⚠️ Note ⚠️
Yes, it was originally made for someone special. But the skills, effort, and joy are all mine and I'm proud to share that with the world now.

## Final Words
If you're just starting your coding journey: let your heart lead the way. Even silly little projects like this can turn into meaningful milestones. :)
